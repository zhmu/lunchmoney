                               LunchMoney!

While I was browsing around on some old backup CD's, I found this nifty game
I once written. It is based on the LunchMoney card game, in which the whole idea
is to kick something knockout, so you can steal h{is,er} lunch money.

With some very minor modifications (GCC 3 doesn't seem to like a loose ; after a
}), the client and server compiled fine and it worked.

The game is not finished, but I'm sure some enterprising soul will find this
code useful or fun to look at :)

Remember it was written in 2002, so my knowledge of C++ was not as extensive
as it is now. But still, the network communication stack is nice; the UI
plainly sucks and has an useless parser :)

Enjoy!
